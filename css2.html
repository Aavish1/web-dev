    <h1>Tiger</h1>
    <p>Tigers are carnivorous animals and eat the flesh of other animals using their hunting skills. They have an orange or white coat covered in thick black stripes. Tigers can live up to 26 years in jungles and 16-18 years in captivity. They are also great swimmers and enjoy taking a dip in the water of the jungle.
        Tigers are powerful hunters with sharp teeth, strong jaws and agile bodies. They are the largest terrestrial mammal whose diet consists entirely of meat; the largest tiger ever recorded was an Amur tiger. The tiger's closest relative is the lion. In fact, without fur, it is difficult to distinguish a tiger from a lion.
